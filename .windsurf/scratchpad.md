# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
Currently working on improving the visual appeal and user engagement in the app. We've added animations throughout the app to make it more engaging and fixed issues with the splash screen.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Animation Issues:
   - Original phoenix animation had loading/compatibility issues
   - Created simpler animations that work reliably on mobile devices
   - Distributed animations throughout the app for visual engagement

2. UI Improvements:
   - Enhanced styling with better typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy
   - Added background animations that don't interfere with functionality
   - Created reusable animation component for consistent implementation

3. Implementation Strategy:
   - Created a reusable AnimatedBackground component that can be used anywhere in the app
   - Fixed TypeScript errors to ensure components work properly
   - Enhanced key screens with subtle animations and better UI

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. Splash Screen Animation Fix
   - [x] Create simplified sun animation to replace phoenix
   - [x] Update SplashPage component to use new animation
   - [x] Test animation on mobile device
   - Success Criteria: Animation displays properly without errors

2. Animation Distribution System
   - [x] Create reusable AnimatedBackground component
   - [x] Support different animation types and positions
   - [x] Add TypeScript support for proper integration
   - Success Criteria: Component can be reused throughout the app

3. UI Enhancement
   - [x] Improve HomeScreen with avatar and date information
   - [x] Enhance ChallengesScreen with background animations
   - [x] Update card styling with better elevation and rounded corners
   - Success Criteria: App has consistent, modern, and engaging design

4. Additional Improvements (Pending)
   - [ ] Add more animation types to the animation library
   - [ ] Enhance screen transitions between app sections
   - [ ] Implement cohesive color theme based on orange/gold palette
   - Success Criteria: Complete visual polish across the app

## Project Status Board
- [x] Create simplified sun animation
- [x] Build reusable animation component
- [x] Enhance HomeScreen UI
- [x] Enhance ChallengesScreen UI
- [x] Test animations on mobile device
- [ ] Add screen transitions
- [ ] Implement cohesive color theme
- [ ] Final testing and polish

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
Current status: Testing the implemented changes to verify:
1. Animations display correctly on mobile devices
2. UI enhancements improve visual appeal
3. No performance issues with animations

After testing, we should prioritize either:
- Adding screen transitions
- Implementing cohesive color theme
- Adding more animation types

## Lessons
- Large base64-encoded assets in Lottie files can cause performance issues
- TypeScript requires explicit type assertions for certain style properties
- Animation opacity should be kept low (~0.1) when used as backgrounds to avoid distraction
- Reusable components allow for consistent implementation of visual elements
