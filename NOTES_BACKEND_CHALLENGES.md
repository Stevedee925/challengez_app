# Backend Challenge Consultation Note

When implementing the backend for the challenges feature:
- **Consult the project owner (Steve) before finalizing the list of challenge options.**
- **Ask for preferences on how challenges should be structured (data model, fields, logic, etc.).**
- **Confirm which backend framework should be used for the challenges feature.**

# Feature Idea: User-to-User Challenge Invitations

Consider implementing a feature that allows users to challenge others, making the app more engaging. Possible invitation methods:
- In-app messaging (if user accounts and messaging are supported)
- SMS/text message (using a service like Twilio)
- Social media sharing (using platform APIs or share sheets)

**Next Steps:**
- Research technical feasibility for each channel (in-app, SMS, social media)
- Design UI/UX for sending and receiving challenges
- Ensure privacy and consent for sending messages
- Consult with Steve before implementation for preferences and priorities
