# Intermittent Fasting and Journaling App

## Background and Motivation
This project aims to create a mobile application for intermittent fasting and journaling using React Native with Expo. The app will help users track their fasting periods, maintain a journal, set challenges, establish rituals, and more. The development approach will focus on building the frontend with dummy data first, then implementing the backend functionality later.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **State Management**: Efficiently managing app state across multiple features (fasting timer, journal, challenges, etc.)
2. **Local Storage**: Implementing effective data persistence using AsyncStorage
3. **UI/UX Design**: Creating an intuitive and engaging user interface
4. **Notifications**: Setting up local push notifications for fasting timers and reminders
5. **Navigation**: Implementing a clean navigation structure between different app sections

## High-level Task Breakdown

   - Success criteria: App has a working navigation system with placeholder screens for all main features

### Phase 2: Fasting Timer Feature
1. Create fasting timer UI components
   - Success criteria: Timer display with start/pause/reset functionality
2. Implement timer logic and state management
   - Success criteria: Timer works correctly and maintains state when navigating between screens
3. Add local notifications for timer events
   - Success criteria: Notifications appear when timer starts/ends

### Phase 3: Journal Feature
1. Create journal entry UI and form
   - Success criteria: Users can view a form to create journal entries
2. Implement journal entry storage with dummy data
   - Success criteria: Journal entries are displayed and can be created/viewed

### Phase 4: Challenges Feature
1. Design challenges UI and components
   - Success criteria: Challenge list and detail views are implemented
2. Implement challenge creation and tracking
   - Success criteria: Users can create challenges and track progress

### Phase 5: Rituals Feature
1. Design rituals UI and components
   - Success criteria: Ritual list and detail views are implemented
2. Implement ritual creation and tracking
   - Success criteria: Users can create rituals and track adherence

### Phase 6: Onboarding and Authentication
1. Create onboarding flow
   - Success criteria: New users see an introduction to the app's features
2. Implement local authentication
   - Success criteria: Users can create accounts and log in (stored locally)

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
Based on examination of the codebase, the project has progressed significantly beyond the initial planning phase:

1. **Version Control & GitHub Integration** üîÑ
   - Local Git repository initialized with initial commit
   - Setting up GitHub remote repository
   - Preparing to commit and push all current progress

2. **Project Structure & Setup** ‚úÖ
   - React Native with Expo project is set up
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Navigation system using React Navigation (bottom tabs + stack navigators)
   - UI components using React Native Paper
   - Basic app structure with screens for all main features

2. **Feature Implementation**
   - **Home Screen** ‚úÖ: Dashboard showing fasting status and recent journal entries
   - **Fasting Timer** ‚úÖ: Fully functional timer with start/pause/end capabilities and progress tracking
   - **Journal** ‚úÖ: Entry creation and viewing with mood selection and tag management
   - **Challenges** ‚úÖ: Challenge creation, tracking, and progress visualization
   - **Rituals** ‚úÖ: Ritual creation with day selection, tracking, and adherence monitoring
   - **Profile Screen** ‚ö†Ô∏è: Basic structure (but minimal implementation)

3. **Data Structure** ‚úÖ
   - Well-defined TypeScript interfaces for all data types
   - Dummy data for testing and development

4. **Next Steps**
   - Test the app on physical devices using Expo Go
   - Implement data persistence with AsyncStorage
   - Add notifications for fasting timers and reminders
   - Enhance the profile screen with user settings
   - Create an onboarding flow

## Testing with Expo Go
To test the app on a physical device using Expo Go:

1. **Start the Expo Development Server**
   - Run `npm start` in the project directory
   - This will start the Metro bundler and provide a QR code

2. **Connect Android Device**
   - Ensure the Android device is on the same Wi-Fi network as the development computer
   - Open the Expo Go app on the Android device
   - Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal/browser
   - If connection issues occur, try using a tunnel connection with `npm start -- --tunnel`

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Changes made to the code will automatically refresh on the device
   - Shake the device to open the developer menu
   - Console logs and errors will appear in the terminal and on the device

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
Successfully set up Expo Go and tested the app on a physical Android device. The app is working well with the following accomplishments:

1. Fixed a theme warning related to font variants by properly configuring the theme with appropriate font styles for all text variants (bodyLarge, bodyMedium, etc.)
2. Verified that the app loads correctly on a physical Android device
3. Confirmed that the UI looks good and is functioning as expected

Current focus: Setting up GitHub integration and version control

Implementation plan:
1. Create a GitHub repository for the project
2. Connect the local repository to the GitHub remote
3. Commit all current changes
4. Push the commits to GitHub

After completing GitHub integration, we'll continue with:
- Creating an onboarding flow for new users
  1. Create onboarding screen components to introduce app features
  2. Set up AsyncStorage to track if a user has completed onboarding
  3. Modify the navigation to show onboarding screens for first-time users
  4. Design engaging and informative onboarding content

## Lessons
- Keep code under 500 lines whenever possible
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before trying to edit it
- Run npm audit if vulnerabilities appear in the terminal
- Always ask before using the -force git command
