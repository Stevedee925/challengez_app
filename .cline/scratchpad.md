# Intermittent Fasting and Journaling App

## Background and Motivation
This project aims to create a mobile application for intermittent fasting and journaling using React Native with Expo. The app will help users track their fasting periods, maintain a journal, set challenges, establish rituals, and more. Additionally, the app is designed to assist in habit building through techniques like habit stacking and mindset development. The development approach will focus on building the frontend with dummy data first, then implementing the backend functionality later.

The project is now focusing on enhancing the onboarding experience with a phoenix-themed design, symbolizing transformation and rebirth. This new onboarding flow will create a more engaging and visually striking first impression for users, reinforcing the app's focus on personal transformation through challenges and habit building.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **State Management**: Efficiently managing app state across multiple features (fasting timer, journal, challenges, etc.)
2. **Local Storage**: Implementing effective data persistence using AsyncStorage
3. **UI/UX Design**: Creating an intuitive and engaging user interface
4. **Notifications**: Setting up local push notifications for fasting timers and reminders
5. **Navigation**: Implementing a clean navigation structure between different app sections
6. **Habit Building**: Implementing effective habit stacking mechanisms and progress tracking
7. **Mindset Development**: Creating features that support positive mindset development and reinforcement
8. **Phoenix-Themed Onboarding**: Creating a visually striking and thematically consistent onboarding experience with animations, custom styling, and personalization options

## Testing with Expo Go
To test the app on a physical device using Expo Go:

1. **Start the Expo Development Server**
   - Run `npm start` in the project directory
   - This will start the Metro bundler and provide a QR code

2. **Connect Android Device**
   - Ensure the Android device is on the same Wi-Fi network as the development computer
   - Open the Expo Go app on the Android device
   - Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal/browser
   - If connection issues occur, try using a tunnel connection with `npm start -- --tunnel`

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Changes made to the code will automatically refresh on the device
   - Shake the device to open the developer menu
   - Console logs and errors will appear in the terminal and on the device

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
I've successfully tested the phoenix-themed onboarding flow on a mobile device using Expo. Here's my testing report:

1. Completed steps:
   - ✅ Reset onboarding state using clearStorage.js
   - ✅ Started the Expo development server with `npx expo start --port 8083`
   - ✅ Connected to a mobile device by scanning the QR code with Expo Go
   - ✅ Modified AppNavigator.tsx to force the onboarding flow to show
   - ✅ Successfully loaded the phoenix-themed onboarding flow on the mobile device
   - ✅ Tested all onboarding pages and navigation
   - ✅ Completed the onboarding flow to access the main app
   - ✅ Restored AppNavigator.tsx to its original state

2. Onboarding flow testing results:
   - **SplashPage**: The splash page displays the app icon, title "Welcome to Challengez", subtitle "Ignite Your Inner Fire", and description text. However, the fade-in animations were not visible on the mobile device.
   
   - **FeatureHighlightsPage**: The feature highlights page shows the title "Embers of Possibility" and allows navigation between three features (Fasting Timer, Daily Journal, Challenges & Rituals). The navigation dots and arrows work correctly, and each feature card animates when switching between features.
   
   - **PersonalizationPage**: The personalization page displays four transformation driver options (Health & Fitness, Personal Growth, Skill Mastery, Mindfulness) that can be selected. The selection state is visually indicated, and multiple options can be selected. The selections are saved to AsyncStorage.
   
   - **AccountCreationPage**: The account creation page provides email/password fields, a Create Account button, social login options (Google and Apple), and a skip option. The password visibility toggle works correctly.
   
   - **FirstChallengePage**: The first challenge page displays a personalized challenge based on the transformation drivers selected on the PersonalizationPage. When Health & Fitness was selected, it correctly showed a 14-Day Intermittent Fasting challenge. The challenge card shows title, duration, difficulty, and description.
   
   - **Navigation**: The Next, Skip, and Get Started buttons work correctly throughout the onboarding flow.

3. Main app testing results:
   - After completing the onboarding flow, the app successfully transitions to the main app with the bottom tab navigation.
   - All main features are accessible.

4. Issues identified:
   - The fade-in animations on the SplashPage were not visible on the mobile device, though all content displayed correctly.
   - The console showed "Challenge accepted" logs when the user accepted the challenge.

5. User feedback:
   - The user described the onboarding flow as "beautiful" but noted it "needs a little work"
   - Overall impression was positive, describing it as "definitely a great start"

6. Potential improvements:
   - Investigate and fix the animation issues on the SplashPage
   - Consider adding more visual elements to enhance the phoenix theme (flames, embers, etc.)
   - Optimize the animations for better performance on mobile devices
   - Add more interactive elements to increase engagement
   - Consider adding a progress indicator to show how far along the user is in the onboarding process

Overall, the phoenix-themed onboarding flow is functioning well and provides an engaging introduction to the app. With some refinements to the animations and visual elements, it could be even more impressive.
